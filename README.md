Project Overview: Curve Regularization and Beautification in 2D Euclidean Space
Objective: The goal is to identify, regularize, and beautify curves in 2D Euclidean space, starting with closed curves and progressing to more complex shapes. The project also explores symmetry and curve completion techniques.

Problem Description:

Input: Initially, line art is presented as polylines (sequences of points) instead of PNG images.
Output: The output is a set of paths with properties of regularization, symmetry, and completeness, represented as cubic Bezier curves for visualization in SVG format.
Key Tasks:

Regularize Curves:
Identify and regularize shapes such as straight lines, circles, ellipses, rectangles, rounded rectangles, regular polygons, and star shapes.
Focus on hand-drawn shapes and doodles, distinguishing between regularizable and non-regularizable shapes.
Explore Symmetry in Curves:
Identify reflection symmetries in closed shapes.
Transform curves into sets of points to detect symmetry and fit identical Bezier curves on symmetric points.
Complete Incomplete Curves:
Develop algorithms to naturally complete 2D curves with gaps due to occlusion removal.
Use computer vision techniques to identify and fill gaps in curves.
Use Cases:

Hand-drawn shapes and doodles.
Visualization and rendering of regularized and beautified curves in SVG format.
This project involves creating algorithms to process and transform line art into aesthetically pleasing and regularized curves, with applications in graphic design, digital art, and computer vision. If you have any further questions or need additional details, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š
